# utils.add

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

`utils.add` is an R package designed to facilitate an eclectic and evolving set of R operations commonly implemented by the author in the course of scientific research and/or other R packages. These functions generally fall into one of the following themes:

* Extract data
* Learn from data
* Modify data
* Common mathematical operations
* Development tools

It is important to emphasise that `utils.add` is not a comprehensive package designed to deliver any one of these themes: many R packages already fill this space. `utils.add` simply makes a few eclectic operations that can be loosely grouped into these themes a bit easier in cases where this has proven useful in the course of the author's research. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `utils.add` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install the development version from github:
devtools::install_github("edwardlavender/utils.add")
```

## Extract data

Some functions facilitate data extraction. These include: 
  
  * `isnt_na()` -- Extract observations which are not NA;
  * `substr_end()` -- Extract the last n letters from a character;
  * `pos_first_unique()` -- Extract the first position of each unique element in a vector;
  * `left()` and `right()` -- Explore the left and right hand side of a dataframe of matrix respectively;
  * `around()` -- Extract the rows in a dataframe around specified position(s);
  * `sterm()` -- Define `mgcv` model smooth term names (e.g. to extract values from `mgcv::predict.gam()`);

## Learn from data

Some functions which facilitate learning from data. These include: 

  * `count_if()` -- Count the number of observations which meet a specified condition;
  * `basic_stats()` -- Compute basic statistics (e.g. `mean`, `mode`, etc.) for a sample;
  * `seq_range()` -- Generate a sequence between two values; 
  * `round_range()` -- Round a range down and up at lower/upper limits respectively;
  * `clip_within_range()` -- Clip a vector to lie within a range; 
  
## Modify data

Some functions facilitate data modification. The include: 

  * `add_list_null()` -- Add `list(NULL)` to a list in replacement of `NULL` elements;
  * `list_merge()` -- Merge lists, accounting for empty lists;
  * `tidy_coef()` -- Tidy a table of coefficients;
  * `add_standard_attr()` -- Add standard attributions (such as the source file and the date) to an object;

## Common mathematical functions

* `linear()` -- A linear function based on parameters `a` and `b`;
* `quadratic()` -- A quadratic function based on parameters `a`, `b`, `h` and `k`;
* `sigmoid()` -- A (centred) sigmoidal function based on parameters `x0`, `L` and `k`;

## Development tools

* `check...()` -- Check arguments supplied via `...` within a function;
* `check_value()` -- Check that the value of an input supplied to a parent function is appropriate;
* `check_class()` -- Check that the class of an inputted object supplied to a parent function is appropriate;
* `check_tz()` -- Check the time zone of an object and, if appropriate and necessary, force UTC;
* `check_names()` -- Check that required names are contained within an object;
* `check_named_list()` -- Check that a list is named; 
* `check_length()` -- Check that the length of an object is the required length;

## Disclaimer

`utils.add` is a new and 'personal' package at an early stage of evolution. Function names, arguments and availability may change.
